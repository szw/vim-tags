1. About                                                      *vim-tags-about*

Ctags support is a great feature in Vim. One approach to make use of Ctags is
the way of Tim Pope's plugins. For example in Rails projects, Ctags are
generated automatically while Bundler is running and installing new gems.

Vim-Tags plugin treats Ctags like more tightly coupled within a concrete
project. It creates '.tags' files directly in the root project directory.
Also, it can perform tags creation upon each file saving through forking -
available under Unix-like operating systems. This option, however, may require
some tweaking under Windows.

Vim-Tags is under active development. Currently, besides its main features, it
provides some support for Ruby/Rails projects (it can generate tags for gems
listed in 'Gemfile.lock' file).

2. Usage                                                      *vim-tags-usage*

The plugin has only one command and a few options described in the
|vim-tags-configuration| section: >

    :TagsGenerate
<

This command generates one or more tags files. By default, it generates only
the "tags" file collecting tags from all files nad subdirectories of the
current working directory - assuming it's the root of the project.

By default, you rarely will have to use this command, because once the "tags"
file is found in the root directory, the tags are generated on each file
saving. So, in most cases, to enable Vim-Tags support just create empty "tags"
file: >

    touch tags

<

and start Vim. On first file saving (any file is considered), the tags will be
generated.

Additionally, you can exclude some directories from the main "tags" file,
especially if they contains rarely changed and heavy content, i.e.
third-party libraries. Those directories must be placed directly at the root.

To exclude them, make empty files named exactly after those directories with
".tags" suffixes: e.g. "vendor.tags" for the "vendor" directory and start (or
restart) Vim. Beginning from the next Vim run, the plugin will be watching
modification times of those directories and corresponding tags files and
perform tags generation only if necessary.

The last but not least feature is the Ruby Bundler support. It's easy and
straightforward. If your project root contains "Gemfile.lock" file, the plugin
will be generating tags for all your Bundler gems referenced in the Gemfile.
Here, "Gemfile.lock" modification time will be taken to find out whether the
tags generation is required, just like in the custom directories case
explained earlier. The plugin will create "Gemfile.lock.tags" file
automatically

3. Configuration                                      *vim-tags-configuration*

Vim-Tags assumes that you have 'ctags' utility available in your shell.
However it is possible to change or improve shell commands used by the plugin,
e.g. in case you have to point a proper binary with absolute path or tweak
some options.

Vim-Tags can be configured by setting some global variables in your ".vimrc"
file.

The available variables are:

                                                    *'vim_tags_auto_generate'*

Default: 1

If enabled, Vim-Tags will generate tags on file saving >

    let g:vim_tags_auto_generate = 1

<

                                             *'vim_tags_project_tags_command'*

Default: "ctags -R {OPTIONS} {DIRECTORY} 2>/dev/null &"

This command is used for main Ctags generation. >

    let g:vim_tags_project_tags_command = "ctags -R {OPTIONS} {DIRECTORY} 2>/dev/null &"

<

                                                *'vim_tags_gems_tags_command'*

Default: "ctags -R -f Gemfile.lock.tags `bundle show --paths` 2>/dev/null &"

Command used for Gemfile tags generation. >

    let g:vim_tags_gems_tags_command = "ctags -R -f Gemfile.lock.tags `bundle show --paths` 2>/dev/null &"

<
